Here's a simple explanation of how **photosynthesis** works:\n\n**Photosynthesis** is a process through which plants (and some other organisms) convert light energy (from sunlight) into chemical energy (in the form of glucose). It happens in plant cells in a process called **chloroplasts**, which use a pigment called **chlorophyll**.\n\nHere's a simplified breakdown:\n\n1. **Light absorption**: Chlorophyll in plant cells absorbs sunlight.\n2. **Water (H\u2082O) takes part**: Water is taken in through the plant's roots.\n3. **Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is taken in**: Through their leaves (stomata), plants take in carbon dioxide from air.\n4. **Energy conversion**: The light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into **glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086)** and **oxygen (O\u2082)**.\n5. **Oxygen is released**: As a byproduct, plants release oxygen into the air.\n\n**Equation**:  \n**6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082**\n\nIn short: **plants use light + water + carbon dioxide \u2192 glucose + oxygen",
